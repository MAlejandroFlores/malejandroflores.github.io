            "description": "William Massimo Rinetti founded Massimo’s Italian Restaurant in 1976. Massimo’s opening was the realization of Bill’s lifelong dream of owning and operating a fine dining establishment. A second generation Californian whose grandparents emigrated from Sicily and the Piemonte region of Italy, Bill acquired his appreciation of cooking in the Italian style in the kitchens of his mother and grandmothers. It was there that his dedication to the finest ingredients, careful preparation, and attention to detail were learned. “Never compromise quality” became the hallmark of his restaurant. At Massimo’s, every dish reflected Bill’s dedication to offering his patrons the finest dining experience possible. Delicious food, elegant ambiance, and professional service became a tradition that is carried on today by his son, Bill Jr.",

Making this vision a reality is one of the greatest and most important challenges any community faces. Research shows that low income preschoolers are up to two years behind their upper income peers in early language and math development. It’s a primary reason why over half of California’s 3rd graders are not proficient in either language or math.",
